# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Joakim Lindquister hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a simple static site with two main files:

- `index.html` - Single page with personal introduction and navigation links
- `styles.css` - Styling with dark theme (#211f1d background, #f8b92e accent color)

## Development

This is a static HTML/CSS website with no build process or dependencies. Changes can be made directly to the files and will be reflected immediately when the site is served.

## Deployment

The site appears to be hosted via GitHub Pages (quist.github.io), so changes pushed to the master branch will be automatically deployed.

## Design System

- Font: Roboto (loaded from Google Fonts)
- Theme colors: Dark background (#211f1d), golden yellow accent (#f8b92e)
- Layout: Centered container (max-width: 700px) with flexbox
- Navigation: Horizontal links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and email
- Hover effects: Font size increase and 1s transition on links
